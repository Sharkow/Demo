# Demo
Hello! These are some parts of my code from different projects.
Most of them are from commercial software, so I merely share little pieces.
#### ExcelHandler.cs [C#, 2013]
A part of a program for automated sorting of Excel sheets.
The user selects two areas on the sheet with two related datasets.
The program sorts the second dataset to match the first in a best way, using specified columns.
#### SHDataHandler.h/m, SHMainMenuViewController.h/m [Objective-C, 2014-2017]
Several parts from my iOS app, LR-West (can be found on the AppStore).
SHDataHandler - routines for getting and storing data from DB, and some related stuff.
SHMainMenuViewController - view controller for the main app screen.
#### ai_split_message.h/cc [C++, 2018]
A module for splitting long messages into smaller ones.
It is a part of a large project for airline industry.
Messages contain information about people who ordered flight tickets, and are composed by certain standards.
Splitting also follows some specific business logic.
#### costFunction.m [Matlab, 2018]
A tiny piece from my homework in Matlab for Andrew Ng's ML course.
#### main.c [C, 2016]
Full code for my fun project - a dancing Pololu 3pi robot (based on Arduino).
This two-wheel robot will actually perform some dancing to a Romeo and Juliette song by Dire Straits.
#### pfs_submit.ipynb, pfs_xgb.py [Python, 2019]
This is my solution for the "Predict Future Sales" Competition on Kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/c/competitive-data-science-predict-future-sales
pfs_submit.ipynb is a full solution in a Jupyther Notebook.
pfs_xgb.py is part of an extended solution in pure Python. (xgb stands for XGBoost).
